                                            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
    dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
    congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
    usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
    don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
    (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
    treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
    becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
    and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
    heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
    People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
    attention. </p>

                                            <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
    disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
    the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
    coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
    around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
    these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
    People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
    person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
    why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
    person who is sick.
    Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
    Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
    transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
    through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
    spread?”
    Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
    The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
    expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
    from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
    people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
    particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
    possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
    a mild cough and does not feel ill.
    Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?
    The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
    appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
    be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a 
    main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
    COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
    this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
    after using the bathroom and before eating.

    Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
    available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
    countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
    have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
    have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
    situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
    You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions:
    • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
    Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
    alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
    • Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
    anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
    droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
    are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
    COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
    • Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
    Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
    Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
    nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
    can make you sick.
    • Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
    respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
    with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then 
    dispose of the used tissue immediately.
    Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
    hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
    cold, flu and COVID-19.
    • Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
    difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
    Follow the directions of your local health authority.
    Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
    information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
    allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
    health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
    of viruses and other infections.
    • Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
    areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
    traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
    have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
    Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of
    these areas.
    Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
    14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading
    o Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for
    everyone)
    o Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even
    with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C
    or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is
    essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go
    out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other
    people.
    Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities
    will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help
    protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other
    viruses.
    o If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
    medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory
    infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
    provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
    Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to
    quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to
    prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses. </p>

                                            <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
    there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
    For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
    still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
    areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
    these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
    and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
    case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
    restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
    disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
    COVID-19.
    COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
    has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
    new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
    situation where you are or intend to go. </p>

    about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
    therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
    outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
    We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
    loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
    actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
    hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local

    and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
    2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
    hand rub or soap and water
    3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
    4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
    5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
    coloured side).
    6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
    the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
    7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
    chin.
    8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from
    behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face
    and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces
    of the mask.
    9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
    10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the
    mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash
    your hands with soap and water.

                                            <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
    animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which 
    may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
    associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by
    dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not
    yet been confirmed.
    To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
    direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.
    Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk
    or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods
    and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

    protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.

                                            <p>It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
    surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
    suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
    COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
    several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
    surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
    If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
    to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with 
    an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
    touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. </p>
